    <h2>⋆˚ʚɞ Description ⋆˚ʚɞ</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its creamy sauce made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and black pepper. Here’s a traditional recipe for making Carbonara:</p>
    <h3><strong>⋆˚ʚɞ Ingredients ⋆˚ʚɞ</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz (340g) spaghetti (or other pasta like fettuccine or linguine)</li>
            <li>4 oz (115g) pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup (100g) grated Parmesan cheese (or Pecorino Romano for a sharper taste)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil (if using garlic)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>⋆˚ʚɞ Steps ⋆˚ʚɞ</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
                <li>Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
                <li>Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Pancetta:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>While the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the diced pancetta (or guanciale) and cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>If using garlic, add it to the skillet in the last minute of cooking the pancetta. Remove the pancetta from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Make the Sauce:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined.</li>
                <li>Season with freshly ground black pepper. You can also add a pinch of salt, but be cautious as the pancetta and cheese are already salty.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Combine Everything:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss to combine and ensure the pasta is well coated with the pancetta fat.</li>
                <li>Remove the skillet from heat. Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing vigorously to combine. The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs gently and create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, gradually add a little of the reserved pasta cooking water until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Serve immediately, garnished with extra grated cheese and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h3><strong>⋆˚ʚɞ Tips ⋆˚ʚɞ</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Timing is Key: </strong> Make sure to mix the egg and cheese mixture with the pasta off the heat to avoid scrambling the eggs.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese Choice: </strong> Pecorino Romano adds a sharper flavor compared to Parmesan, so use it if you prefer a stronger cheese taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Creaminess: </strong> The creamy texture comes from the eggs and cheese, not from cream. If you want a richer sauce, you can add a bit of cream, but it’s not traditional.</li>
        </ul>
