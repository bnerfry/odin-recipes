            <li>1 can (15 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

        <p><strong>For the Toppings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz (225g) fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced or torn into pieces</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil (for drizzling)</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>⋆˚ʚɞ Instructions ⋆˚ʚɞ</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast (and sugar, if using) in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, until it becomes frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
                <li>Mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface or using a stand mixer with a dough hook for about 7-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Tomato Sauce:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens. Adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to its highest setting (typically 475-500°F or 245-260°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
                <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into 2 or 3 equal portions, depending on the size of the pizzas you want to make.</li>
                <li>Roll out one portion of dough on a floured surface into a thin circle or rectangle. Transfer the rolled dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet or a pizza peel if using a pizza stone.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
                <li>Evenly distribute slices or pieces of fresh mozzarella over the sauce.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and crispy and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately top with fresh basil leaves. Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper if desired.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy it fresh from the oven!</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>⋆˚ʚɞ Tips ⋆˚ʚɞ</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pizza Stone: </strong> Using a preheated pizza stone can help achieve a crispy crust.</li>
            <li><strong>Dough: </strong> If you have time, letting the dough rise slowly in the refrigerator overnight can develop more flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Mozzarella: </strong> Fresh mozzarella is key for the authentic taste and texture. Avoid using pre-grated cheese if possible.</li>
        </ul>
